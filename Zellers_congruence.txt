Una curiosidad:

The year 1 BC is considered to be the year right before the start of the AD (Anno Domini) era.
However, there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, which means that the year immediately before AD 1 is 1 BC.

To find out what day of the week December 31, 1 BC, falls on, we can use
a tool or algorithm for calculating the day of the week for any given date.
One commonly used algorithm is the Zeller's Congruence.

Using Zeller's Congruence for December 31, 1 BC:

h = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) % 7

Where:

h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)
q is the day of the month (31)
m is the month (12)
K is the year of the century (1 BC => -1)
J is the zero-based century (1 BC => 0)


Plugging in the values:

h = (31 + floor(13 * (12 + 1)/5) - 1 + floor(-1/4) + floor(0/4) + 5*0) % 7
h = (31 + floor(13 * 13/5) - 1 + 0 + 0 + 0) % 7
h = (31 + 33 - 1) % 7
h = 63 % 7
h = 0

So, December 31, 1 BC, fell on a Saturday (h = 0).
